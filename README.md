# UserBrowserModel
"Traditional web clickstream analysis, limited to single websites, overlooks the complex, multi-faceted nature of modern browsing. This research introduces a novel, client-side machine learning approach that models comprehensive user behavior by incorporating cross-website interactions, including multi-tab branching and backtracking. By processing data directly within the user's browser, we enhance privacy while gaining a more holistic understanding of browsing patterns. Our model, trained on a user study designed around established information-seeking strategies, demonstrates a strong ability to distinguish between browsing behaviors and predict future actions. A subsequent qualitative analysis revealed five distinct browsing patterns, highlighting the efficacy of our overparameterized model in capturing and interpreting complex human interaction sequences."
